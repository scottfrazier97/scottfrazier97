I am passionate about becoming the best data scientist I can be. Currently, I am focused on refining my skills in programming and statistics to help companies better understand their data and enhance performance through actionable insights.

I am open to collaboration on a variety of projects and eager to gain experience not only in coding but also in working within a team environment.
